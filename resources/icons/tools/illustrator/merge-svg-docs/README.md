# AboutThis script is a JSX (JavaScript Extension) script for Adobe Illustrator to merge a folder of SVG files into a single Illustrator document. The script creates a new artboard named according to the file name (minus the .svg file extension), places the SVG file contents, centers the object, and aligns to the nearest pixel.# CREDITSTODO: I need to look up the original source.

It was written to complete a one-off personal project. If you find it useful, fantastic. But I cannot verify whether or not it will work on every system.## SETUP  1. Place this script in Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2018/Presets/en_US/Scripts/     **NOTE**        _If you are not using the US English translation of Adobe Illustrator,     the `en\_US` folder will match that of your translation._        _Also, the Adobe Illustrator folder may have a different name depending on which     version of Illustrator you have installed._  2. Restart Adobe Illustrator to activate the script  3. The script will be available under menu `File > Scripts > Merge SVG Files`.  4. Enter values in the dialog for Artboard Width, Artboard Height, Artboard Spacing  5. Choose the folder of SVG files. Nested folders are fine. The script will search through any nested folers for SVG files.     6. When the script runs, you will be asked to select a source folder of SVG files. The script will ignore any non-SVG files.     6. The script will create a new Adobe Illustrator document with an artboard for each SVG file. Please note that Adobe Illustrator allows up to 1,000 artboards so the script will only work on the first 1,000 files it finds.   9. If logging is enabled (in the startup dialog) the script will create a log file named `ai-script-log.txt` on the Desktop of your computer. To turn this off, set the variable named `logging` to `false` near the top of the script.
