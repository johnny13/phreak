# Quick Helper

Quickly print out useful information for a given subject. Example:

```shell
php phreak qh yarn
```

Will print out some saved information about yarn. 

```shell

■■■◤ ◢■■■■■■■■■■◤◢■■◤◢■■◤◢■■
▛▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▜
▘  Yarn                    ▝
▖                          ▗
▘  blah blah blah          ▝
▖                          ▗
▘  CMD    | FUNCTION       ▝
▖  global | askldfjl;kasd  ▗
▘                          ▝
▖  etc                     ▗
▙▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▟

```

The information would be pulled from the saved PHP flat file database, or referenced from a saved markdown file.
